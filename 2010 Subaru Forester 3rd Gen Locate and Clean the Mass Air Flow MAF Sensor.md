# 2010 Subaru Forester (3rd Gen) - Locate and Clean the Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor

## Summary
This DIY tutorial demonstrates how to locate and clean the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor on a 2010 Subaru Forester (3rd generation). The presenter explains that this simple maintenance task, often charged by technicians, can resolve common dashboard warning lights and drivability issues including check engine lights, flashing cruise control, and traction control lights that Forester owners frequently experience.

## Key Concepts
- The MAF sensor is a common source of problems in Subaru Foresters when dirty or contaminated
- Cleaning the MAF sensor can resolve multiple dashboard warning lights simultaneously
- Common symptoms include: misfire-like feeling, check engine light (solid), flashing cruise control light, and flashing traction control light
- The procedure is simple enough for DIY completion, saving money on technician fees
- Proper cleaning requires only basic tools and specialized cleaner
- The sensor is easily accessible in the engine bay
- Dirt buildup at connection points inside the sensor causes the issues
- Quick-drying electronic cleaner can substitute for dedicated MAF cleaner

## Actionable Takeaways
1. **Locate the MAF sensor** - It's positioned prominently in the engine bay (shown in video)
2. **Remove two Phillips head screws** securing the sensor and store them safely
3. **Disconnect the sensor** by pushing the tab and wiggling it free
4. **Spray the sensor** thoroughly with MAF sensor cleaner or quick-dry electronic cleaner, focusing on the connection points inside
5. **Let it dry completely** - the quick-drying formula evaporates rapidly
6. **Reassemble** by reconnecting the sensor (listen for the click), repositioning it, and securing with the two screws
7. **Test drive** the vehicle to confirm the warning lights are cleared

## Important Quotes
- "Once you know how to do this and once I learn how to do this you'll be really surprised how simple it is"
- "Nine out of ten times...the majority of times it will clear that issue up"
- "You should wear gloves and keep your hands clean your significant other will thank you"
- "You'll get dirt built up inside of here at these connection points"
- "This won't affect it if this stuff dries it's quick drying just give it a good cleaning"

## Technical Details

**Tools Required:**
- Phillips head screwdriver
- MAF sensor cleaner (preferred) OR Quick-Dry (QD) Electronic Cleaner
- Safety gloves (recommended)
- Paper towels or oil pan to catch excess cleaner

**Procedure:**
1. Two Phillips screws secure the MAF sensor
2. Electrical connector has a push-tab release mechanism
3. Listen for a "click" when reconnecting to ensure proper seating
4. Spray tube attachment helps direct cleaner into sensor housing
5. Allow complete drying before reinstallation (typically only a few minutes)

**Related Issues:**
- Check engine light (solid)
- Flashing cruise control light
- Flashing traction control light
- Misfire sensation while driving

## Resources Mentioned
- QD Electronic Cleaner (Quick Drying Formula) - as alternative to dedicated MAF cleaner
- Reference to creator's earlier videos for additional context

recall what they charge uh can't even recall what they charge uh can't even recall what they charge uh maybe i can put it in the description maybe i can put it in the description maybe i can put it in the description i'll do a little research but honestly i'll do a little research but honestly i'll do a little research but honestly once you know how to do this and once i once you know how to do this and once i once you know how to do this and once i learn how to do this you'll be really learn how to do this you'll be really learn how to do this you'll be really surprised how simple it is surprised how simple it is surprised how simple it is also also also well first off it's located right here well first off it's located right here well first off it's located right here all right also there is an issue with all right also there is an issue with all right also there is an issue with foresters and maybe other subarus where foresters and maybe other subarus where foresters and maybe other subarus where um um um when you get in the car uh it feels like when you get in the car uh it feels like when you get in the car uh it feels like there's like a misfire it's kind of there's like a misfire it's kind of there's like a misfire it's kind of driving weird and you'll have the check driving weird and you'll have the check driving weird and you'll have the check engine light coming up will be on solid engine light coming up will be on solid engine light coming up will be on solid the cruise control will be flashing i the cruise control will be flashing i the cruise control will be flashing i believe and uh believe and uh believe and uh the traction control will also be the traction control will also be the traction control will also be flashing all right it's a very weird
