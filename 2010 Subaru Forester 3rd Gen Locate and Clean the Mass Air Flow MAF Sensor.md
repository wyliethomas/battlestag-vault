# 2010 Subaru Forester (3rd Gen) - Locate and Clean the Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor

## Summary
This tutorial demonstrates how to locate and clean the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor on a 2010 (3rd generation) Subaru Forester. The video addresses a common issue where the check engine light, cruise control, and traction control lights flash simultaneously, often accompanied by what feels like a misfire. Cleaning the MAF sensor typically resolves this problem and is a simple DIY task that mechanics charge significantly for.

## Key Concepts
- **MAF Sensor Location**: Located in the air intake system, easily accessible under the hood
- **Common Symptom Pattern**: Check engine light (solid), flashing cruise control light, and flashing traction control light appearing together
- **Driving Issues**: Vehicle may feel like it has a misfire or drive irregularly when MAF is dirty
- **Simple Maintenance**: This is a straightforward DIY task that doesn't require mechanical expertise
- **Cost Savings**: Can be done at home instead of paying a technician
- **Applicable Models**: Works for 2010 and other third-generation Foresters, possibly other Subarus
- **Success Rate**: Cleaning the MAF sensor resolves the issue the majority of the time
- **Quick Drying**: The cleaning process takes only a few moments to dry

## Actionable Takeaways
1. **Gather materials**: Phillips head screwdriver, MAF sensor cleaner (or QD quick-dry electronic cleaner as alternative), gloves, paper towels or oil pan
2. **Remove the sensor**: Unscrew two Phillips head screws holding the MAF sensor in place
3. **Disconnect**: Push the small tab and wiggle to disconnect the electrical connector
4. **Clean thoroughly**: Spray the sensor with cleaner, focusing on connection points and interior where dirt builds up
5. **Allow to dry**: Let the sensor dry completely (takes only a few moments with quick-dry formula)
6. **Reinstall**: Reconnect the electrical connector (listen for click), align the sensor, and replace the two screws
7. **Test drive**: This should resolve the check engine/cruise control/traction control flashing issue

## Important Quotes
- "This is something you've probably seen before a technician might have told you you need to get it clean...they charge a bit of money for it"
- "Once you know how to do this and once I learn how to do this you'll be really surprised how simple it is"
- "When you get in the car it feels like there's like a misfire...you'll have the check engine light coming up will be on solid, the cruise control will be flashing...and the traction control will also be flashing"
- "It's a very weird thing to see on your dashboard it'll freak you out"
- "Cleaning this mass airflow sensor will...the majority of times it will clear that issue up"
- "I suggest wearing gloves...you should wear gloves and keep your hands clean your significant other will thank you"
- "A lot of times what happens is you'll get dirt built up inside of here at these connection points"
- "This won't affect it...just give it a good cleaning"

## Technical Details
**Tools Required:**
- Phillips head screwdriver
- MAF sensor cleaner (preferred) or QD quick-dry electronic cleaner (alternative)
- Disposable gloves (recommended)
- Paper towels or oil pan to catch spray

**Procedure:**
1. Locate MAF sensor in air intake (accessible from engine bay)
2. Remove two Phillips head screws
3. Push connector tab and wiggle to disconnect
4. Spray interior of sensor thoroughly, focusing on connection points
5. Allow to dry (minimal time with quick-dry formula)
6. Reconnect with audible click
7. Reinstall with two screws

**Vehicle Application:**
- 2010 Subaru Forester
- All 3rd generation Foresters
- Possibly other Subaru models with similar design

## Resources Mentioned
